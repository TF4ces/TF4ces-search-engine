# TF4ces Search Engine

An experiment driven Search Engine Project, developed to index and retrieve best documents given a query using ensemble of models.

      - [X] BM25 Model + MPNet Model
      - [X] Hyperparameter tuning
      - [X] Ensemble Pipeline
 - [X] Phase 3
      - [X] RoBERTa Model
      - [X] Ensemble enhancement
      - [X] Experimentation
  
  
## Future works

## How to run Project

Note : The project was tested on linux and MacOS. (Windows has dependency issues, refer Troubleshooting)

1. Clone repository
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/TF4ces/TF4ces-search-engine.git
    ```
    
2. Setup Environment repository
    ```console
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate                [LINUX/MAC]
    $ .\venv\Scripts\activate                 [WINDOWS]
    $ pip install -r src/requirements.txt 
    ```
    
3. Download pre-loaded embeddings to this path: `./dataset/embeddings_test` from [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-lOZMwBK5Ea9eCDE18gQCTnukZ16xQT/view?usp=share_link)
   
   **Note**: To generate embeddings from scratch run[./tests/test_evaluate_model.py](tests/test_evaluate_model.py) script setting MODEL to `all-mpnet-base-v2`, `all-roberta-large-v1` individually twice. 
   
   **WARNING**: use a GPU machine and it is expected to take 1hr to generate.


3. Run TF4ces Search Engine [install jupyter by `pip install jupyter notebook` and to run `jupyter notebook`]
      
   1. Run Eval Pipeline from [./tests/notebooks/TF4ces_Search_Eval.ipynb](./tests/notebooks/TF4ces_Search_Eval.ipynb) ipynb notebook.
   2. Run prediction Demo Pipeline from [./tests/notebooks/TF4ces_Search_Demo.ipynb](./tests/notebooks/TF4ces_Search_Demo.ipynb) ipynb notebook.


### Troubleshooting :

1. **Windows Systems are seen to have issue while reading data with ir-datasets==0.4.1**
      
      For windows the doc.iter might throw decoding error while reading tsv file,
      You would need to change the encoding in source files of dependency as per this issue.
